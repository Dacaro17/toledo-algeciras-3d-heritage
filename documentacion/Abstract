An integrated methodology is proposed for the heritage reconstruction of urban environments through digital modeling and 3D printing, applied to the cases of Toledo and Algeciras. Based on an iterative, critical, and empirical approach, it develops a workflow that integrates archaeological and historiographic analysis with three-dimensional design tools (Blender), fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing, and selective use of artificial intelligence for optimization and verification processes.
Among its main contributions is the implementation of a modular shell system that allows different historical phases of a city to be represented on a shared topographic base, as well as the physical validation of the generated models through printed prototypes. The methodology has been designed from the outset to ensure traceability, accessibility, and replicability, and proves to be highly transferable to educational, museographic, and social contexts. Inclusive uses are also explored, such as tactile stations for visually impaired individuals and adapted models for open culture and community heritage initiatives.
This approach positions 3D modeling and AI as tools that support a more accessible, critical, and participatory form of historical understanding, offering a practical foundation for future projects in virtual archaeology, educational design, and local heritage engagement.
